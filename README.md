# Extracting Hidden Neural Representations In Human Visual Perception

How does our brain encode and process information about the objects we see every day? We analyze brain activity across individuals performing a visual task to extract hidden neural representations using data driven approaches that go beyond simple object recognition, revealing a richly organized and slightly individual-dependent structure of visual object processing.

This repository is created to host codes for my Bachelor's thesis under the guidance of Dr. Martin Hebart from Max Planck Insitute of Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

My final bachelor's thesis is attached as a `Bachelors Thesis Report`.
